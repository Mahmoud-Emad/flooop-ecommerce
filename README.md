Detailed Explanation :
    I was impressed by the idea of Amazon, 
    then decided to develop a web application that simulates a part of Amazon
    Here you can view your product to sell
    You can also add any product you like to your shopping cart
    I also set up a small branch called One Coin
    You can buy any product only with One Coin
    You have a shopping cart for buying the One Coin product
    You can add a profile for you, follow your orders, buy via Paypal and register on the flooop of course
