                    We are working to ensure that no one artificially raises prices on basic need products during this pandemic and have blocked or removed tens of thousands of items, in line with our long-standing policy.

        You can submit a pricing concern to us by clicking Report incorrect product information on the product detail page, then select Other product details, then Price issue. While we are not able to respond directly to all reports, we appreciate your feedback.

                <small >
                    Yes. Flooop's delivery partners have been advised to reduce contact with customers by placing packages at the customer's doorstep and stepping back. If an ID check is required, these are now performed at a distance.
        
        You can also choose a safe location where the driver can leave your package if you are not able to answer the door. To provide delivery instructions, please go to Your Address Book and select "Add delivery instructions" for the address you want to update.
